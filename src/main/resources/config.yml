# Locator Plugin Configuration

# Whether stealth mechanics are enabled globally.
# When enabled, players can hide from the locator by sneaking,
# wearing a mob head/pumpkin, or having invisibility.
stealth-enabled: true

# Whether anchor waypoints are enabled globally.
# When enabled, a waypoint is left at the player's last position
# when they change dimensions.
anchor-enabled: false

# Distance to project waypoints from the viewer for angular precision.
# Higher values = smoother movement on the locator bar.
# The waypoint position is projected this many blocks away from the viewer
# in the direction of the target, reducing integer rounding jitter.
projection-distance: 50.0

# How often waypoint positions are updated (in ticks). 1 tick = 50ms.
# Lower = smoother but more packets sent. 1 is the smoothest.
update-interval: 1

# The waypoint transmit range set on tracked players' proxy waypoints.
# This should be high enough to cover any distance on the server.
transmit-range: 999999.0
